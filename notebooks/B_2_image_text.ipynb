      "\n",
      "1. **Tracks**: The diagram shows multiple railway tracks, labeled as \"UP MAIN\" and \"DOWN MAIN,\" indicating the direction of travel.\n",
      "2. **Signals**: Various signals are marked with numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 31, 34, 35, 36). These signals control train movements and ensure safe operation.\n",
      "3. **Distances**: Distances from the signal box are indicated in yards (e.g., 1203 YDS. FROM BOX, 300 YDS. FROM BOX, 171 YDS. FROM BOX).\n",
      "4. **Fixed Signals**: Some signals are marked as \"FIXED,\" indicating they are permanently set and do not change.\n",
      "5. **Electric Release**: There is a note about an electric release to a 2-lever ground frame.\n",
      "6. **Spare Levers**: The diagram lists spare levers (1, 4, 8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 29, 32, 33) that are not currently in use.\n",
      "7. **Junctions**: The diagram shows connections to other junctions, such as \"FROM BRAITHWELL JCN.\" and \"TO BULLCROFT JCN.\"\n",
      "8. **Level Crossing**: There is a mention of \"PIPERING LANE CROSSING,\" indicating a level crossing at this location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this diagram provides a detailed overview of the signaling and track layout at Doncaster Junction, essential for railway operations and safety.\n"
