- Use types everywhere possible.
- Use Python 12 capabilities when it's relevant
- Keep Python module presentation short.  Include main classes and functions description (one line). 
- Don't repeat code examples in module description if they are already in function docstrings. 
- Don't add comments for classes fields and arguments. Write only one line to describe the class.
- Rules for doctrings:
    - Use Google style 
    - Don't mention types 
    - Don't mention raise ValueError 
    - Use  ``` to format code in documentation (Fenced Code Blocks)
